# scalavista

A Scala language-server based on Akka-http and Scala's presentation compiler. 

For now it only serves as a back-end for the neovim-scalavista plugin; 
see https://github.com/buntec/neovim-scalavista. However, it could be used for any other editor that 
supports communication via http. 

This project is in alpha stage and should be considered unstable.
